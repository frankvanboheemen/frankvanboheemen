    	<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p>This project is part of my activities at <a href="http://www.noodlewerk.com">Noodlewerk Apps</a> and started in the Fuzzy Front End of design, ending with the delivery of an ‘App Store ready’ mobile application.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Feed Me is a tool for parents of a newborn child to <strong>easily track nutrition, sleep, diapers and medicine use</strong> to <strong>get a grip on, set goals for and make sense of</strong> the daily care for their child.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During this project I completed about 95% of the work on my own. This meant that I was not only responsible for the <strong>UX design</strong> and <strong>Visual Design</strong> (including animations), but I also <strong>developed</strong> the app with its cloud-backend and wrote the textual communication.</p>

<p>Curious how it works? You can download the app from <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/feed-me-baby-food-sleep-en-diapers-tracker/id1086102489?mt=8">the App Store</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-this-project-came-about">How this project came about</h3>

<p>During this project I entirely redesigned and rebuilt <a href="http://www.noodlewerk.com/blog/feed-me-app/" target="_blank">an app Michiel Boertjes had built</a> for keeping track of the nutrition of his daughter. At first the app was meant for personal use, but later he decided to also place it in the App Store as a product of Noodlewerk Apps.</p>

<p>The app became quite popular and with its popularity came the the (inevitable) bug reports and requests for additional features. But there was also a bigger problem looming: the backend, built in a platform called Parse, would soon stop working because Parse was shutting down. So the big question at that moment was: Are we shutting down Feed Me or are we rebuilding the app from scratch and continuing?</p>

<p>We decided to base our decision on whether we could find a suitable replacement for Parse. After a quick evaluation we found a potential replacement for Parse in an Apple service named: <strong>CloudKit</strong>. So, that meant work had to be done!</p>

<h3 id="process">Process</h3>

<h5 id="inspiration-from-feed-me-10">Inspiration from Feed Me 1.0</h5>

<p>It was clear that three features of the old Feed Me should be maintained in the new design:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything should be on <strong>one screen</strong> to create a complete overview of the current situation.</li>
  <li>The app should be <strong>easily used with only one hand</strong>; the other is of course already occupied with holding the child.</li>
  <li>Caring for a child is not a one person job, so <strong>sharing (and synchronising)</strong> the care for the child should also be possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>With my new design the intention was not to create something entirely new. I wanted to keep and enhance the best features of the old app and maintain its core identity.</p>

<p><img class="small" src="/images/feed-me/tutorial.gif" style="width: 256px;" /></p>

<h5 id="design-goal">Design goal</h5>

<p>As a foundation during my entire process I captured the essence of what I think Feed Me should be and I specified the character and tone of the new design in the following design goal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A tool for parents to get a grip on, set goals for and make sense of the current situation in order to give them the feeling of confidence and pride about how they care for their child.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="competitor-research">Competitor research</h5>

<p>I conducted a specified competitive product research to discover with what kind of features I could expand Feed Me and to determine an effective way of communicating to the target user of Feed Me: the concerned parent.</p>

<p>I started this research by identifying two main different types of apps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apps for <strong>‘power users’</strong>. This is a type of app that allows the user to adjust almost everything to their needs. It requires the user to invest a large amount of time in getting to know and learning how to use the app to get the most out of the product.</li>
  <li>Apps that <strong>guide</strong> you every single step with the use of multiple views per action and an ample amount of explanation.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a more indepth analysis I picked three competitive products: one power user app, one guiding app and one a that is a bit in between. To communicate my findings in an (for others) informative an attractive way, I combined them in an infographic.</p>

<p><a href="/images/feed-me/competitorsBig.png" target="_blank"><img class="small" src="/images/feed-me/competitors.png" /></a></p>

<p>This analysis combined with the inspiration from Feed Me 1.0 allowed me to conclude the following implications for the design:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Next to nutrition, suitable variables to track using Feed Me are sleep, diapers and medicine use. These are things that are at the forefront of caring for a newborn and that usually occur multiple times per day.</li>
  <li>The app should include a guided first use with a thorough explanation of what the app does and how it works, but the main use of the app should have as little steps as possible.</li>
  <li>To not get lost, both adding data entries as well as having an overview should happen on the main screen.</li>
  <li>The emphasis in designing the UX should lie on cleanliness and straightforwardness.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="ux-design">UX design</h5>

<p>For the UX design I performed iterations using a variety of prototyping tools such as <strong>pen and paper, illustrator/ Sketch and Framer.js</strong>.</p>

<p>One of the most challenging aspects, that I have spent a lot of time on, is how to add more features to the main screen without cluttering the user interface. To achieve this, I created a <strong>clear hierarchy in the main view</strong> for different elements:</p>

<p><img class="small" src="/images/feed-me/uxMain.png" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>The <strong>navigation bar</strong> is the top level and determines the content. Here the user sees which child is now selected for tracking nutrition, sleep, diapers and medicine use.</li>
  <li>The <strong>middle</strong> section shows the current state. Here the user sees all the entries chronologically as well as day totals.</li>
  <li>The <strong>tabbar</strong> in the bottom of the screen is the starting point for creating new entries.</li>
</ol>

<p>For each of these three levels a careful balance between conventional and unconventional UI elements has been established. New interactions are based on known conventions, in order to establish an easy learning curve and to prevent the perception of unexpected app behaviour by the user.</p>

<p><img class="small" src="/images/feed-me/animation.gif" style="width: 256px;" /></p>

<p>An example is the aforementioned tabbar in the bottom of the screen. It is a conventionally recognizable part of the UI for users as a starting point, but, instead of navigating to a new screen, tapping one of the tabbar buttons pops up the custom ‘keyboard’.</p>

<h5 id="visual-design-and-textual-communication">Visual design and textual communication</h5>

<p>Choices for the visual design were made alongside the creation of the UX design. Because there’s already a lot going on on the main screen, I opted for a non-distracting neutral style to create calmness and clarity. The soft but diverse pastel colours were chosen because they are not necessarily feminine or masculine, but still baby-themed.</p>

<p><img class="small" src="/images/feed-me/icons.png" /></p>

<p>The way the colours are used also communicates and strengthens the UX design. A variation of messages in text, images and animations in the same visual style are also used to inform and guide the user.</p>

<h5 id="building-the-app">Building the app</h5>

<p>Up until I started with Feed Me I had never built an entire application from scratch. Sure, I had worked on applications, but never before have I been responsible for the creation of an entire app from start to finish. It required me to familiarize myself with determining a <strong>Minimal Viable Product (MVP)</strong> together with the <strong>order of building the features</strong>, while also keeping the bigger picture in mind by creating proper classes and other objects and planning the <strong>app architecture</strong>.</p>

<p>By doing so I developed my own system for app architecture based on <a href="https://github.com/nvh/Coordinating-presentation" target="_blank">Protocol Oriented Coordinators by Niels van Hoorn</a>. I will make this available in the future when I have made it presentable.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>

<p>At the time that I am writing this my design is at a beta-stage. This means that it will be distributed amongst first time testers through Apple’s service called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/testflight/" target="_blank">TestFlight</a>. We hope that this will give us enough insights to finalise the first version of the redesign of Feed Me.</p>

<p>At this point already two major features are planned that we want to implement in the near future:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We would like to expand the <strong>accessibility</strong> of the app to also include blind or visually impaired users.</li>
  <li>More emphasis on the second part of the design goal which is <strong>setting goals and making sense of the data</strong>. We already invision this as an entire new layer of functionality to the app.</li>
</ul>
